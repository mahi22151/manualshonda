How to Update Your Honda GPS System, Navigation, Software, App, and Maps Manually
==================================================================================

Keeping your Honda GPS fully updated ensures accurate navigation,
improved performance, and access to the latest maps and features.
Manual updates give you full control over the process and allow you
to install updates even without an active Wi-Fi connection. This guide
explains how to manually update your Honda GPS system, navigation,
software, app, and maps.

Why Manual Updates Are Important
--------------------------------

Manual updates provide several benefits:

- Greater control over installation timing
- Access to the latest map and software versions
- Improved navigation accuracy
- Better system stability and performance
- Compatibility with areas that lack Wi-Fi access

Without updates, your GPS system may display outdated roads,
incorrect routes, or old points of interest.

Step 1: Identify Your Honda Navigation System
---------------------------------------------

Before starting, determine which navigation system your Honda uses:

- Factory-installed built-in Honda navigation
- HondaLink infotainment system
- Garmin-based navigation system

You can check your owner’s manual or navigate to
``Settings > System Information`` on your infotainment screen.

Step 2: Prepare a USB Drive
---------------------------

Most manual Honda GPS updates require a USB flash drive.

1. Use a blank USB drive with at least 16GB of storage.
2. Format the USB drive to FAT32 (or the format specified in your manual).
3. Insert the USB drive into your vehicle’s USB port.
4. Follow on-screen prompts to copy vehicle identification data.

This process links the update files specifically to your vehicle.

Step 3: Download the GPS Software and Map Updates
-------------------------------------------------

After preparing the USB drive:

1. Remove the USB drive from the vehicle.
2. Insert it into your computer.
3. Open the Honda navigation update software for your model.
4. Check for available system, software, or map updates.
5. Download and install the updates onto the USB drive.

.. note::
   Large map updates may take time depending on your internet speed.
   Ensure your computer remains powered during the download.

Step 4: Install the Update in Your Honda
----------------------------------------

Once the USB drive contains the update files:

1. Start your vehicle or switch to accessory mode.
2. Insert the USB drive into the vehicle’s USB port.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to begin installation.

.. warning::
   Do not turn off the vehicle or remove the USB drive
   during the installation process. Updates may take
   20–60 minutes depending on the file size.

Step 5: Manually Update the Honda GPS App
-----------------------------------------

If you use the HondaLink or Honda GPS app on your smartphone:

1. Open your device’s app store.
2. Search for the HondaLink or Honda navigation app.
3. Select **Update** if a new version is available.

After updating the app, reconnect it to your vehicle via Bluetooth
or USB to sync the latest features.

Step 6: Verify the Update
-------------------------

After installation:

1. Navigate to ``Settings > Navigation > Version Information``.
2. Confirm the updated map and software version numbers.
3. Enter a destination to test accurate routing.

How Often to Perform Manual Updates
-----------------------------------

It is recommended to check for updates at least once or twice per year.
Road networks and points of interest change frequently, so keeping your
maps current ensures reliable navigation.

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

If the update fails or does not start:

- Ensure the USB drive is properly formatted.
- Confirm the correct update was downloaded for your model.
- Make sure the vehicle remains powered during installation.
- Restart the infotainment system and try again.

If issues persist, contact a Honda dealership or certified service center.

and maps ensures accurate directions and improved performance.

you can maintain a reliable navigation experience and avoid outdated
routing information.
